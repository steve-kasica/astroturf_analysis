1108042,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,
James Keene",1,2
8694367,"It should have been obvious the last time this was attempted that the FCC's Open Internet Rules (net neutrality rules) are extremely important to me and millions like me. I urge you to protect them.

I don't want ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

Now is not the time to let giant ISPs censor what we see and do online.

Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the vital privacy and access rules we demanded and so recently won. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations mean that ISP monopolies can’t slow or block Internet users’ access to certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach consumers faster. That’s the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

The internet provides endless creative opportunities and has allowed for people to be able to learn about other perspectives and other people. It allows us to connect with people and I believe that that connection and sharing of viewpoints helps kill hatred, prejudice, and ignorance. To make this change would be a crime. The internet can show the worst in humanity at times but it also allows us to come together as a whole and to be the best in humanity.

I'm a free market supporter, but Internet Service Providers do not operate under the conditions of the free market. In my city, there is only one option for Internet access at home: Cox Communications. While we have other ISPs available, such as Frontier Communications or satellite internet providers, these options are far too slow and far too expensive to be real options. There are no plans for these providers to change their services any time soon. 

There is no competition in the consumer ISP business. I HAVE to use Cox. I don't have a choice. So, if they decide to pick a favorite business, throttle Netflix, or Amazon, or Hulu because they've made a deal to deliver content more quickly, I cannot switch to another provider. The market is broken. Until new technology comes around to disrupt the physical cable to the home connection with as good or better connection speeds, latency, and reliability, Cox has a monopoly. Monopolies must be regulated. 

Don't reclassify ISPs and subject consumers to the whims of ISP corporations when we have no choice in the market.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.

9070012,"This is a letter I wrote myself, not a stock letter. I care!!! The FCC's Open Internet Rules (net neutrality rules) are extremely important to me. I urge you to protect them.

I don't want ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

Now is not the time to let giant ISPs censor what we see and do online.

Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

8998596,"Cable and phone companies provide access to the internet. They're telecommunications carriers. They do not (and should not) have the right to censor or slow down my speech and my access to online content.

I want the FCC to retain the ability to stop my internet service provider from interfering with my communications choices. The courts have already told the FCC that to do this, ISPs must remain under Title II.  

We have little to no choice of internet provider at the local level and so were Net Neutrality rules to be removed along with Title II, it is not merely an option for Americans to switch providers should they find themselves with limited internet access.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the telecom giants like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon the authority to engage in data discrimination, stripping users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I’m afraid of a “pay-to-play” Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that ISP monopolies can’t slow or block our ability to see certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach consumers faster. That’s the right kind of forward-looking approach to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want.

1132460,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,
Stephanie Holmes",1,2

14255494,"Dear FCC/Congress,

On behalf of the Republic of Internet Junkies, I would like to thank you for taking this time out to allow me to voice my concerns over net neutrality. 

Ever since it's inception followed by the establishment of the World Wide Web back in 1989/1990, the internet has proven itself to be one of the most powerful platform ever harvested to connect people from different corners of the world disregarding their races, ages, religions and political views. It is also proved itself to be a faster and (sometimes not necessarily) reliable tool to inform, thus also allowing people to express their freedom of speech, posting cat videos, and enjoy countless wonders of the internet. 

Now with the rise of the new administration, myself personally from a collective group of individuals, believes that our freedom and democracy should treat net neutrality  as an open field where people could post discussion, criticisms and personal opinions without restrictions and censorships that would potentially monopolized by giants and corporations who's scheme is to take over control of the government and turn their deep pockets into a business field that would eventually taking over the advantages of the people.

In the end, we strongly support net neutrality and our common beliefs that the internet should not be a source solely just for monetization and slowing down our internet providers service, but also a realm where different voices can be heard as well as providing an alternative pathway to the mainstream forms of entertainment. After all, the gaming and other various streaming industries need net neutrality more than ever to preserve our own unique culture and the similarities that we all share. 

Once again, thank you for taking this time off to review our concerns, and we've hoping that a reasonable and diplomatic solution shall be established to protect the very basic things that we love. 

Sincerely,
A Concerned Citizen",1,-1

8912838,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

7439475,"Chairman Pai’s proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai’s pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s proposed rules.

10492066,"Instead of a pre-fabricated letter which will likely stagnate in redundancy, I wish to issue a personal statement of why I support net neutrality.\n\nA free and open methodology of electronic communication is vital to the fluidity of a democratic society. There's a reason why we've referred to websites for specific community congregations as ""forums"" since their inception. To inhibit the accessibility of digital information and communication is to strike at the very historical core of public discourse, rational debate, and artistic expression. Every major and successful democracy in the history of human civilization has utilized their own version of a public forum. Inversely, every authoritarian, corrupt, and otherwise morally or progressively backwards system has sought to counteract the free flow of information and ideologies.\n\nNet neutrality is about much more than who pays how much money for a network service.  It is about giving every voice and video feed an equal footing. It is about ensuring impoverished children can access free encyclopedias and the collective knowledge of human civilization anytime, anywhere, regardless of socioeconomic disenfranchisement. Net neutrality is about preserving free market principles and allowing individual merchants to openly and fairly compete with organizations that are orders of magnitude larger than themselves.  Computers and phones are by extension libraries and marketplaces in our pockets and homes, even if we choose not to use them or view them as such. It would be illegal for Congress to set rental prices for library books depending on who generated or provided the content, and likewise, by law there should be a laissez-faire approach to how such information is provided to the public. It would also be illegal for Congress to supersede the First Amendment rights of freedom of assembly.\n\nAs the son of a librarian and the thankful beneficiary of a democratic social structure, I firmly believe in the power of freely accessible information. Ending net neutrality will only benefit a select few who already tip the scales of justice with their economic clout, and will further the divide between the haves and the have nots.\r\nNick Ring",1,-1

1185027,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster.

Thankfully, the current FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can’t block or slow users’ access to certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach people faster.

I don't want ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

Now is not the time to let giant ISPs censor what we see and do online.

Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the telecom giants like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the necessary privacy and access safeguards we worked for and so recently won. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations mean that Internet providers can’t block or slow users’ ability to see certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach customers faster. That’s the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposal would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

It gives me a chance to be exposed to opinions, facts, art, and stories I'd never get to hear on my own. It gave me the chance to tell my mother about the terrorist attacks in her country of origin and the people who live there and were being affected by it to tell the world what was going on and call for help.

701078,"Restoring Internet Freedom? Are you kidding me? If you want to restore internet freedom, then undo the government mandate that prevents me from freely choosing my internet service provider. Until that time, the FCC better do everything in its power to protect my internet freedom. The new FCC Chairman claims there was no proof that companies like Comcast and ATT have been throttling legal services, and yet all he has to do is look at the mounds of evidence collected stating that in fact companies like Comcast and ATT have used their position to degrade the quality of service of products, sites, and services or requiring consumers to pay more to access competitors services that compete with their own. In fact, ATT is doing that now by saying that their own services do not count against their self imposed data caps. The zero rating program clearly states that there is no extra charge to use their own services, but if a consumer wants to use a competitors service (and remember consumers cannot freely choose ISPs because of the FCC) they will have to use their allotted bandwidth our pay more. There are only two ways to protect internet freedom.

7387937,"Chairman Pai’s proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai’s pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s proposed rules.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding and to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II and microbusinesses like mine.

3750287,"Rolling back net neutrality rules would be a devastating blow to Americans and the principle of free and fair markets. The Internet is no longer a luxury, and has not been for a while. It is essential to the function of our economy and will be even more so going into the future. By eliminating the 2015 Net Neutrality rules you would be allowing a select few corporations in an oligopoly to stifle innovation and competition by charging higher rates to companies for priority access to their end users (or possible even access at all), thus increasing barriers to enter digital content markets. Similarly, you would allow those same few corporations to charge more to their end users for not throttling their connection to high bandwidth services. Telecommunications companies, specifically the ones that offer broadband Internet, already have a monopoly in most places in the United States, so the argument that users that see higher prices would simply switch to another ISP is ridiculous. There is no free market when it comes to ISP choice for the vast majority of Americans. Where there is a free market is online with digital content providers and online retailers. Eliminating net neutrality will be granting a few large corporations the ability to further gouge their customers while reducing free market competition online.",1,-1

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

Chairman Pai's proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai's pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

1092067,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression.

9173276,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the legal cover to throttle whatever they please, stripping consumers of the necessary access and privacy safeguards we demanded and won just two years ago. 

I’m afraid of a “pay-to-play” Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to hand the telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the vital privacy and access rules we fought for and so recently won. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules mean that ISPs can’t slow or block Internet users’ ability to see certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach consumers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That’s not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the meaningful privacy and access protections we demanded and won just two years ago. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can’t slow or block users’ access to certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach customers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

I use the internet on a daily basis for simple things: cross checking things, looking for a particular song, asking common questions I don't know the answer to, watching videos. Yet these simple things aren't the only things I entertain myself with,  I talk to friends and people who matter to me deeply on apps here and websites that help me form and keep connections, I apply for jobs, I tend to do much of my shopping here due to social anxiety. The internet has helped me in more ways than I can express and it matters very much to me, the freedom I'm granted with it along with the endless options before me. The internet has made it so there is no excuse to be ignorant, knowledge just sentences and questions away. It helps many students complete their homework in minutes time and takes away the stress of school, help those with long distance bonds keep those important to them, when someone is having a small emergency and doesn't know what to do they can simply look it up. It has made life so simple and it's become so essential rightfully. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.",1,15

7942909,"As an Internet user, I’m asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to hand the telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast the legal cover to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the vital access and privacy safeguards we demanded and so recently won. 

I’m afraid of a “pay-to-play” Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations mean that ISP monopolies can’t block or slow Internet users’ ability to see certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach customers faster. That’s the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposal would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I’m writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

    The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 

    The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard.

    Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.

    Thank you! 

Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing Title II net neutrality rules.",1,15

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the legal cover to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the vital access and privacy rules we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I’m afraid of a “pay-to-play” Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can’t block or slow customers’ ability to see certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services more money to reach consumers faster. That’s the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposal would help turn ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The internet is one of the few places people can express themselves and meet with people they could never meet otherwise, it allows people to be who they are and express who they want to be to the entire world, or just play a game with a friend in a different state or country, but doing this will make us no better than china and sesame credit, making thought policing one step closer to being a reality.

I don't want ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

Now is not the time to let giant ISPs censor what we see and do online.

Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the vital privacy and access safeguards we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations mean that ISPs can’t block or slow Internet users’ access to certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach customers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as larger players. Pai’s proposal would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

Dear FCC 
I think that it is really dumb that you would even try to take away our net neutrality. Just so some big companies like Verizon can make more money! I am a high school student and the internet is really important to me because anyone can have a voice and I can learn so much from it!

1163236,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

So I'm also sending this to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II, and denounce Chairman Pai's plans. Do whatever you can to dissuade him.

Thank you!

3468923,"To the Federal Communications Commission:  I'm a voter worried about regulations on the Internet. I want to suggest the commissioners to rescind Obama's order to regulate Internet access. Individual Americans, rather than unelected bureaucrats, should be able to use the products we prefer. Obama's order to regulate Internet access is a distortion of the open Internet. It disrupted a market-based framework that performed supremely smoothly for decades with nearly universal consensus.",2,14
